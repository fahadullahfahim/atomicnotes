## The Marvelous Cow

Cows are fascinating creatures that play a vital role in agriculture and the environment. They are large, domesticated mammals known for their gentle nature and valuable contributions, such as milk, meat, and leather. Cows have a four-chambered stomach, which allows them to efficiently digest tough plant materials through a process called rumination. They are also social animals that form strong bonds with their herd members. Fun fact: cows have a great sense of smell and can detect scents up to six miles away!
